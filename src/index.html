          <h4 class="font-semibold mb-2">Climbing wall</h4>
          <p class="mt-2 ml-3 mr-2"> In the image we show you a wooden and metal climbing wall that we installed in our village years ago.
            <p>The sport of climbing has evolved by ascending different types of climbing routes at ever-increasing grades of difficulty. 
              Professional mountain guides or rock climbing guides, were an important element in developing the popularity of the sport in the natural environment, and remain so today.</p>
          </p>
          <p class="mt-2 ml-3 mr-2">It is very common for us to climb mountains, but this is only possible with strong and constant training and the climbing wall allows us to enjoy climbing close to home.
            Holds can be changed depending on the climber's level and training need. Very convenient if what we are looking for is to improve our performance and enhance teamwork.
            If we had to choose between mountain or indoor, I think that each perfectly complements the skills required in this type of sport.</p>
          <p class="mt-2 ml-3 mr-2 mb-5">This year we started climbing in schools, an educational and sports project born with the idea of transmitting the sport of climbing to girls. Children and adolescents of school age through the construction of children's climbing walls in educational centers.</p>

            <p>According to wikipedia, competition climbing: A regulated competitive sport of recent origins from the 1980s, normally practiced as indoor climbing on artificial climbing walls that resemble natural formations.
               The International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC) is the official governing body for competition rock climbing worldwide and is recognized by the IOC and GAISF and is a member of the International World Games Association (IWGA). 
              The UIAA is the official governing body for competition ice climbing worldwide. Competition rock climbing has three major disciplines: Lead climbing (performed as sport climbing), Bouldering, and Speed climbing (performed as top roping); competition climbing is sometimes confusingly called "sport climbing".</p>
